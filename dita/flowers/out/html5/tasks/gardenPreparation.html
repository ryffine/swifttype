            <p class="p">An appreciation of the conditions under which bulbs grow in nature is of considerable
                help in understanding their needs in
                            cultivation,
                but is by no means all-sufficient. When plants are grown away from their native
                homes-and perhaps are accommodated in pots indoors-they may respond to quite
                different soils, temperatures, moisture conditions, etc., than those to which they
                are subjected in the
                    wild.

                    achieve, but generally an earth midway between sand and clay and containing a

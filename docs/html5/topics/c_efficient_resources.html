      <p class="p" id="conceptId__p_cf1_glc_rr">Guaranteed resource access provides flexible scheduling capabilities
        within <dfn class="term">StormCluster</dfn>
        <dfn class="term">ClusterControl</dfn>. Scheduling that
        works the way you need it to, ensuring that resources are allocated to users and jobs in a
        fashion consistent with your business needs. With extended on-demand scheduling policies,
        you now have simplified administration and an optimal alignment of business requirements
        with available infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="p" id="conceptId__p_edj_glc_rr">Business needs are established through an analysis of performance demands
        using <dfn class="term">ClusterView</dfn> and <dfn class="term">ClusterAnalyzer</dfn>, projections of expected
        demands, and forecasts of future workloads. The business needs in turn will determine the
        resources that will be required, the scheduling rules that will need to be put into place,
        and the job management framework that is put into place.</p>

      <p class="p" id="conceptId__p_tr1_hlc_rr">The true scheduling features of <dfn class="term">StormCluster</dfn> provide the ability to
        fine-tune the defintions that determine user priority and enable different sharing policies
        by project, team, or department. Job preemption controls help maximize productivity and
        asset use by preempting only the jobs that should be preempted.</p>

      <p class="p" id="conceptId__p_jdx_hlc_rr">You can easily add more than 148,000 cores and 500,000 queued jobs,

        submissions, dynamically adjustable swap space estimates, flexible data handling and the
        smart handling of dependencies in job arrays. By leveraging these capabilities, <dfn class="term">ClusterControl</dfn> administrators can
        ensure that users will spend less time waiting for the cluster, and more time focused on
        their work.</p>
